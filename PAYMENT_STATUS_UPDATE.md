# Payment Status & End Time Updates

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Fixed End Time Behavior (`clockOut.ts`)

**Previous behavior:** When an employee clocked out, the `endTime` field was automatically set to the clock out time.

**New behavior:** The `endTime` remains as the expected/scheduled end time that was set when the job was created. This is separate from the `clockOutTime` which tracks when the employee actually finished.

**Key distinction:**
- `endTime` = Expected end time (set when creating job)
- `clockOutTime` = Actual time employee clocked out

### 2. Added Interactive Payment Status Toggles

Created new functionality to allow admins to toggle payment and invoice statuses directly from the job details page.

#### New Files Created:

**`PaymentStatusButtons.tsx`** - Client component with interactive toggle buttons
- Displays current payment and invoice status
- Allows admins to click to toggle between paid/unpaid and sent/not sent
- Shows visual feedback with icons and colors
- Disabled for non-admin users

**`toggleJobPaymentStatus.ts`** - Server actions
- `togglePaymentReceived()` - Toggles payment received status
- `toggleInvoiceSent()` - Toggles invoice sent status
- Both functions:
  - Verify user is admin
  - Update the job record
  - Create activity log entries
  - Revalidate relevant pages

#### Updated Files:

**`jobs/[id]/page.tsx`**
- Added import for `PaymentStatusButtons`
- Added `isAdmin` check to determine user permissions
- Replaced static payment status display with interactive buttons

## How It Works

### For Admins:
1. View job details page
2. See the Payment Status section
3. Click on "Payment Received" or "Invoice Sent" to toggle
4. Status updates immediately
5. Activity log records who made the change and when

### For Employees:
- Buttons are displayed but disabled
- Shows current status but cannot modify

## Activity Logging

Every time a payment status is toggled, an entry is added to the job's activity log showing:
- Who made the change
- When it was made
- What changed (old value â†’ new value)
- Human-readable description

Example log entries:
- "Payment marked as received by John Doe"
- "Invoice marked as sent by Jane Admin"

## Visual Design

The toggle buttons use the consistent teal color scheme:
- Active states use solid teal colors
- Inactive states use muted/transparent teal
- Hover effects provide feedback
- Icons change based on state:
  - âœ“ CheckCircle for paid
  - âœ— XCircle for unpaid
  - ðŸ“„ FileText for invoice states

## Testing

To test the feature:
1. Log in as an admin
2. Navigate to any job details page
3. Click the payment/invoice status buttons
4. Verify the status changes
5. Check the Activity Log section to see the logged changes
6. Try as a non-admin user to verify buttons are disabled

## Benefits

1. **Quick Updates**: Toggle status with a single click
2. **Audit Trail**: All changes are logged automatically
3. **Permission Control**: Only admins can modify statuses
4. **Real-time Feedback**: Immediate visual update without page reload
5. **Accurate Tracking**: End time remains as scheduled, not affected by clock out
